\Level 0 {Const}

\Level 1 {Const arguments}
\label{sec:constparam}

Function arguments marked \indextermtt{const} can not be altered by
the function code. The following segment gives a compilation error:
%
\verbatimsnippet{constchange}

The use of const arguments is one way of protecting you against yourself.
If an argument is conceptually supposed to stay constant, the compiler
will catch it if you mistakenly try to change it.

\Level 1 {Const references}

A more sophisticated use of const is the
\indextermbus{const}{reference}:
\begin{verbatim}
void f( const int &i ) { .... }
\end{verbatim}
This may look strange. After all, references, and the
pass-by-reference mechanism, were introduced in
section~\ref{sec:passing} to return changed values to the calling
environment. The const keyword negates that possibility of changing
the parameter.

But there is a second reason for using references. Parameters are
passed by value, which means that they are copied, and that includes
big objects such as \n{std::vector}. Using a reference to pass a
vector is much less costly in both time and space, but then there is the
possibility of changes to the vector propagating back to the calling
environment.

Marking a vector argument as const allows
\indextermbus{compiler}{optimization}. Assume the function~\n{f} as
above, used like this:
\begin{verbatim}
std::vector<double> v(n);
for ( .... ) {
  f(v);
  y = v[0];
  ... y ... // code that uses y
}
\end{verbatim}
Since the function call does not alter the vector, \n{y}~is invariant
in the loop iterations, and the compiler changes this code internally to
\begin{verbatim}
std::vector<double> v(n);
int saved_y = v[0];
for ( .... ) {
  f(v);
  ... saved_y ... // code that uses y
}
\end{verbatim}

Consider a class that has methods that return an internal member by
reference, once as const reference and once not:
%
\snippetwithoutput{constref}{const}{constref}

We can make visible the difference between pass by value and pass by
const-reference if we define a class where the
\indextermsub{copy}{constructor} explicitly reports itself:
%
\verbatimsnippet{classwithcopy}
  
Now if we define two functions, with the two parameter passing
mechanisms, we see that passing by value invokes the copy constructor,
and passing by const reference does not:
%
\snippetwithoutput{constcopy}{const}{constcopy}

\Level 1 {Const methods}

We can distinguish two types of methods: those that alter internal
data members of the object, and those that don't. The ones that don't
can be marked \indextermtt{const}:
\begin{verbatim}
class Things {
private:
  int i;
public:
  int get() const { return i; }
  int inc() { return i++; }
}
\end{verbatim}
While this is in no way required, it can be helpful in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item It will catch mismatches between the prototype and definition of
  the method. For instance,
\begin{verbatim}
class Things {
private:
  int var;
public:
  int f(int ivar,int c) const {
    return var+c; // typo: should be `ivar'
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
Here, the use of \n{var} was a typo, should have been \n{ivar}. Since
the method is marked \n{const}, the compiler will generate an error.
\item It allows the compiler to optimize your code. For instance:
\begin{verbatim}
class Things {
public:
  int f() const { /* ... */ };
  int g() const { /* ... */ };
}
...
Things t;
int x,y,z;
x = t.f();
y = t.g();
z = t.f();
\end{verbatim}
Since the methods did not alter the object, the compiler can conclude
that \n{x,z} are the same, and skip the calculation for~\n{z}.
\end{itemize}

\Level 0 {Auto}

This is not actually obscure, but it intersects many other topics.

\Level 1 {Declarations}

Sometimes the type of a variable is obvious:
\begin{verbatim}
std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>*
  myvar = new std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>
                ( 20, new myclass(1.3) );
\end{verbatim}
(Vector of 20 shared pointers to \n{myclass}, initialized with unique instances.)
You can write this as:
\begin{verbatim}
auto myvar =
  new std::vector< std::shared_ptr< myclass >>
            ( 20, new myclass(1.3) );
\end{verbatim}

\begin{block}{Auto plus}
  \label{sl:auto-plus-const}
  Keywords like \n{const} and the reference character~\n{\&} can be
  added:
\begin{verbatim}
// class member
  some_object my_object;
// class method:
  some_object &get_some_object() { return my_object; };
// main program:
auto object_copy  = thing.get_some_object();
auto &object_mutable  = thing.get_some_object();
const auto &object_immutable  = thing.get_some_object();
\end{verbatim}
\end{block}

\Level 1 {Iterating}

\begin{block}{Auto iterators}
  \label{sl:auto-iterator}
\begin{verbatim}
vector<int> myvector(20);
for ( auto copy_of_int : myvector )
s += copy_of_int;
for ( auto ref_to_int : myvector )
ref_to_int = s;
\end{verbatim}
Can be used with anything that is iteratable\\
(vector, map, your own classes!)
\end{block}

\Level 0 {Casts}
\label{sec:cast}

In C++, constants and variables have clear types. For cases where you
want to force the type to be something else, there is the
\indextermdef{cast} mechanism. With a cast you tell the compiler:
treat this thing as such-and-such a type, no matter how it was
defined.

\Level 1 {Casting constants}

One use of casting is to convert to constants to a `larger' type. For
instance, allocation does not use integers but \indextermtt{size_t}.

\verbatimsnippet{longintcast}

C++ pointers are really memory addresses, with no type information to it.
With a \indexterm{cast} it becomes possible change your mind about
what a pointer is.

The statis cast is also useful for dealing with a \indextermsub{void}{pointer}.

The \indextermtt{static_cast} has the safety feature that the compiler
will complain if the conversion is not possible.

\Level 1 {Dynamic cast}

If we have a pointer to a derived object, stored in a pointer to a
base class object, it's possible to turn it safely into a derived
pointer again:
\begin{verbatim}
derived_object *derived_pointer;
basic_class *basic_pointer;
derived_pointer = dynamic_cast<derived_object*>(basic_pointer);
if (derived_pointer==nullptr)
  // cast failed
\end{verbatim}

Using a \n{static_cast} here would lead to a compiler error.

\Level 1 {Legacy mechanism}

The syntax `open parenthesis, type, closing parenthesis' means:
\begin{itemize}
\item take whatever you have here,
\item and interpret it as the specified type.
\end{itemize}
Example:
\begin{verbatim}
int i[2];
double *point_at_real = (double*)i;
cout << "Print two integers as double: " << *point_at_real << endl;
\end{verbatim}

This is very dangerous. It is also impossible to search for such a
thing in your editor. Please use the mechanisms above.

\Level 0 {lvalue vs rvalue}
\label{sec:lrvalue}

The terms `lvalue' and `rvalue' sometimes appear in compiler error
messages.
\begin{verbatim}
int foo() {return 2;}

int main()
{
    foo() = 2;

    return 0;
}

# gives:
test.c: In function 'main':
test.c:8:5: error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
\end{verbatim}

See the `lvalue' and `left operand'? To first order of approximation
you're forgiven for thinking that an \indextermdef{lvalue} is something
on the left side of an assignment. The name actually means `locator
value': something that's associated with a specific location in
memory. Thus is lvalue is, also loosely, something that can be modified.

An \indextermdef{rvalue} is then something that appears on the right
side of an assignemnt, but is really defined as everything that's not
an lvalue. Typically, rvalues can not be modified.

The assignment \n{x=1} is legal because a variable \n{x} is at some specific
location in memory, so it can be assigned to. On the other hand,
\n{x+1=1} is not legal, since \n{x+1} is at best a temporary,
therefore not at a specific memory location, and thus not an lvalue.

Less trivial examples:
\begin{verbatim}
int foo() { x = 1; return x; }
int main() {
  foo() = 2;
}
\end{verbatim}
is not legal because \n{foo} does not return an lvalue. However,
\begin{verbatim}
class foo {
private:
  int x;
public:
  int &xfoo() { return x; };
};
int main() {
  foo x;
  x.xfoo() = 2;
\end{verbatim}
is legal because the function \n{xfoo} returns a reference to the
non-temporary variable \n{x} of the \n{foo} object.

Not every lvalue can be assigned to: in
\begin{verbatim}
const int a = 2;
\end{verbatim}
the variable \n{a} is an lvalue, but can not appear on the left hand
side of an assignment.

\Level 1 {Conversion}

Most lvalues can quickly be converted to rvalues:
\begin{verbatim}
int a = 1;
int b = a+1;
\end{verbatim}
Here \n{a} first functions as lvalue, but becomes an rvalue in the
second line.

The ampersand operator takes an lvalue and gives an rvalue:
\begin{verbatim}
int i;
int *a = &i;
&i = 5; // wrong
\end{verbatim}

\Level 1 {References}

The ampersand operator yields a reference. It needs to be assigned
from an lvalue, so
\begin{verbatim}
std::string &s = std::string(); // wrong
\end{verbatim}
is illegal. The type of \n{s} is an `lvalue reference' and it can not
be assigned from an rvalue.

On the other hand
\begin{verbatim}
const std::string &s = std::string();
\end{verbatim}
works, since \n{s} can not be modified any further.

\Level 1 {Rvalue references}
\label{sec:rvalue-ref}

A new feature of C++ is
intended to minimize the amount of data copying through
\indexterm{move semantics}.

Consider a copy assignment operator
\begin{verbatim}
BigThing& operator=( const BigThing &other ) {
  BigThing tmp(other); // standard copy
  std::swap( /* tmp data into my data */ );
  return *this;
};
\end{verbatim}
This calls a copy constructor and a destructor on \n{tmp}. (The use of
a temporary makes this safe under exceptions. The \indextermtt{swap}
method never throws an exception, so there is no danger of half-copied
memory.)

However, if you assign
\begin{verbatim}
thing = BigThing(stuff);
\end{verbatim}
Now a constructor and destructor is called for the temporary rvalue object on
the right-hand side.

Using a syntax that is new in \indexterm{C++}, we create an
\indextermbus{rvalue}{reference}:
\begin{verbatim}
BigThing& operator=( BigThing &&other ) {
  swap( /* other into me */ );
  return *this;
}
\end{verbatim}
